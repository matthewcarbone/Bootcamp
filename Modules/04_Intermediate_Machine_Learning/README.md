# Intermediate machine learning

Despite the ubiquitousness of modern-day large language models and other neural networks, a tremendous amount can be accomplished using simpler models. Not only this, but a significant amount of key concepts in machine learning can be more easily demonstrated using approaches which "leave aside" the complexities of neural networks and advanced optimizers. In this set of modules, we present multiple walkthroughs of non-neural network-based machine learning methods.
