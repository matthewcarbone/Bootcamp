# Intermediate machine learning

</div>

Despite the ubiquitousness of modern-day large language models and other neural networks, a tremendous amount can be accomplished using simpler models. Not only this, but a significant amount of key concepts in machine learning can be more easily demonstrated using approaches which "leave aside" the complexities of neural networks and advanced optimizers. In this set of modules, we present multiple walkthroughs of non-neural network-based machine learning methods.

1. [K-nearest neighbor regression](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthewcarbone/Bootcamp/blob/master/Modules/04_Intermediate_Machine_Learning/01_KNN.ipynb) - An introduction to K-nearest neighbor regression. This notebook also covers a few key concepts in machine learning, such as hyperparameter tuning and the train/test/validation split.
2. [Support vector machines](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthewcarbone/Bootcamp/blob/master/Modules/04_Intermediate_Machine_Learning/02_SVM.ipynb) - An extremely detailed and comprehensive overview of support vector machines, including much of the mathematics behind the practice. Also discusses the kernel trick.
3. [Support vector machines, simple example on Iris Classification](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthewcarbone/Bootcamp/blob/master/Modules/04_Intermediate_Machine_Learning/03_SVM_Iris_Classification_Example.ipynb) - A simplified version of the above SVM notebook, focusing on the Iris dataset.
4. [Random forests](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthewcarbone/Bootcamp/blob/master/Modules/04_Intermediate_Machine_Learning/04_RF.ipynb) - An introduction to random forests, including a discussion of entropy and a real-world scientific use case.
