# Introduction to Python

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This is your starting point for the Bootcamp. The point of this module is to give you an introduction to the basics of the Python programming language. It assumes you know nothing, but it also assumes that you will "immerse" yourself to some degree. I.e., you need to "google around", use Stack Overflow and just generally have the attitude that you're going to "debug anything and everything" in order to get the most out of this.
