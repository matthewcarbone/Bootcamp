# Introduction to Machine Learning

</div>

This module will contain basic modules for introducing you to the most important concepts of machine learning, that of the model (used to fit data), the optimizer (used to "train" the model) and the notion of a "cost function" (a measure of how well a model fits data). We will largely demonstrate these key concepts using the simplest machine learning models: linear and logistic regressors.

# Nice datasets

During interactive sessions with instructors, we recommend the following two datasets for starting your machine learning journey. 

* For **regression** problems, try the [California Housing Dataset](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/python_scripts/datasets_california_housing.html)
* For **classification** problems, try the [Iris Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_iris_dataset.html)

Each of the above links provides the required information to use the Sci-kit Learn API to fetch the data right while you're using Python. No need to download anything separately!
