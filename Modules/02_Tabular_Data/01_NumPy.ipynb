    "Broadcasting is one of NumPy's most powerful built in tools. It essentially deals with how NumPy treats arrays of arbitrarily different shapes. There's really no better way to explain broadcasting for the first time than to show a few examples. For more details, check out NumPy's [broadcasting documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/basics.broadcasting.html).\n",

    "A quick note: in the \"element wise operations\" section, you've already done the most basic form of broadcasting! NumPy has to figure out, for example, how to \"multiply\" an array and a number. It is not obvious at first what the behavior of this will be. For example, consider what happens when you multiply a standard Python list by an integer:"
