# Tabular data

</div>

This module provides an admittedly sparse overview of tabular data in Python, specifically NumPy. The objective is that we get to all the core functionality, while also providing other curated resources to help in your understanding. We will also go over the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for more advanced tabular data processing and visualization. In addition, more notebooks showcasing some nice applications of NumPy, Pandas, etc. to scientific problems.

# Modules

1. [Introduction to NumPy](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthewcarbone/Bootcamp/blob/master/Modules/02_Tabular_Data/01_NumPy.ipynb) - A basic introduction to tabular data and, in particular, the NumPy numerical computing library. Essentially all numerical computing in Python is built on NumPy.
2. [Introduction to Pandas](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthewcarbone/Bootcamp/blob/master/Modules/02_Tabular_Data/02_Pandas.ipynb) - An extension of the NumPy notebook, this notebook introduces Pandas, for more general tabular data needs, including mixed-data-type tables.

# Exercises

[Estimate the area of a circle with Monte Carlo](https://colab.research.google.com/github/matthewcarbone/Bootcamp/blob/master/Modules/02_Tabular_Data/03_Circle_Monte_Carlo.ipynb) - In this notebook, we examine a classic exercise: how does one estimate the area of a circle without calculus?
