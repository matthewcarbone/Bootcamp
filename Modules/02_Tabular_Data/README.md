# Tabular data and visualization
This module provides an admittedly sparse overview of tabular data in Python, specifically NumPy. The objective is that we get to all the core functionality, while also providing other curated resources to help in your understanding. We will also go over the Pandas and Matplotlib libraries for more advanced tabular data processing and visualization. In addition, more notebooks showcasing some nice applications of NumPy, Pandas, etc. to scientific problems will also be provided.
