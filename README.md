This is a 2-week AI/ML bootcamp originally created using the Rising STEM Scholars funding. It is intended for students and professionals at all levels, and assumes little-to-no knowledge of Python or machine learning concepts. Enjoy!

# ðŸ“• Bootcamp overview

## Basic Python, data science, and machine learning

If you are new to these concepts, start here!
